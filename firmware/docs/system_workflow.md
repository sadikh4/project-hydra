## HYDRA System Workflow

1. User places recyclable material on the platform
2. Load cell measures applied weight
3. Weight is checked against thresholds
4. If valid:
   - Water dispensing is triggered
   - Eco-points are incremented
5. Cooldown prevents repeated misuse
6. System resets for next cycle
